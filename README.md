Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model (AFFDM)
Project Description
This project focuses on building an advanced machine learning model aimed at detecting financial fraud. Using a rich dataset, various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and classification algorithms are implemented to accurately identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

The model leverages data analysis, feature extraction, and supervised learning methods to flag suspicious activities and enhance security in financial systems.
