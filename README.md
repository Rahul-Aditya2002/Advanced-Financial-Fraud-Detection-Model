Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model (AFFDM)
Project Description
This project focuses on building an advanced machine learning model aimed at detecting financial fraud. Using a rich dataset, various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and classification algorithms are implemented to accurately identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

The model leverages data analysis, feature extraction, and supervised learning methods to flag suspicious activities and enhance security in financial systems.

Setup Instructions
Requirements
Python 3.x

Key libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

Install dependencies using:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project Locally
Clone this repo:

bash
git clone 
cd your-affdm-repo
Verify your dataset file paths in AFFDM-Advanced-Financial-Fraud-Detection-Model-Project-2.py match your local machine setup and update if necessary.

Run the main script:

bash
python AFFDM-Advanced-Financial-Fraud-Detection-Model-Project-2.py
Power BI Report Access
The full Power BI dashboard for this project is too large to include here (over 1 GB). It is hosted externally on Google Drive for convenient access.

Please download and open with Power BI Desktop to explore detailed visualizations.

Notes
Keep your dataset files organized and update paths when running on different machines.

The Power BI visualizations complement the Python model by providing dashboard insights for fraud detection.
